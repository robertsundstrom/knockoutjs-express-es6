# knockoutjs-express-es6
Sample demonstrating how to implement a Single-Page Application (SPA) with the MVVM pattern using KnockoutJS, Express.js and ECMAScript 6.

The project is using SystemJS (module loading), BabelJS (for ECMAScript 6), and JSPM (for package management) on the frontend (under "wwwroot").

ZURB Foundation 5 is used as frontend framework.

The SPA structures is mainly based on that introduced in this blog: https://sumitmaitra.wordpress.com/2014/08/04/part-3-ko-components-routes-and-hashes/
